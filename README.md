# BirthdayReminderApp
## PRODUCT DESIGN SUPER LEAGUE Level 1 Assignment
### BirthYAY - A mobile application to remember the birthdays that matter
#### Some of us don't use Facebook as much as we used to and if we do, it might be purely to keep track of our friend's birthdays. For those of us who want to delete the Blue App from our phones, please design the main page of a mobile app that helps users keep track of birthdays.

#### This page should display the following information fro each birthday:
#### - Birthdate
#### - Name of the Person

#### - A button to text the birthday person via WhatsApp
#### - Ability to check a box to receive a reminder (in case the user wants the app to remind them in advance that a birthday is coming up)
